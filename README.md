This is a proof-of-concept application. Tax brackets are hardcoded. The purpose
behind this project was to learn [React](https://reactjs.org) and associated
technologies, such as
[ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html),
[Babel](http://babeljs.io), [ESLint](https://eslint.org),
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com),
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Development

To run an active development build:

```sh
npm start
```

## Production

To deploy for production:
